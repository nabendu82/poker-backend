# Connection with MongoDB

- Create a new database from [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
- Get the connection string which contains username, password and the url
- Rename the **.env.test** file to **.env**.
- Replace the connection string with the one you got from MongoDB Atlas
- Add the /pokerDiceGame at the end

## Running locally

Just give the **npm start** command from a terminal.
Make sure you have installed all packages by giving the **npm i** command earlier.
